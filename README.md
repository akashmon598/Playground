- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate with other content creators to improve my knowledge.

### GUI PROGRAM TO DETECT DISEASES IN TOMATO PLANT USING AN IMAGE OF ITS LEAF & CONTROLLING THE SONY CAMERA TO CAPTURE THE IMAGE OF THE LEAF 

NOTE: ALL THE MENTIONED GITHUB REPO'S AND DATASET LINK WILL BE ATTACHED BELOW.

I have made a GUI program to detect the diseases in the tomato plant using an image of the leaf. The GUI also controls a specific set of sony cameras to capture the image and send it to the user's pc for processing. The main design and functions of the application are as given below.


1. OPEN IMAGE:  This button is used to open the image of the leaf with which the disease has to be detected.
2. PROCESS:    The process button is used to process the input image of the leaf, inspect and identify the disease on the plant.
3. CAPTURE: The capture button will capture the image from the Sony camera. For achieving this I have used the **SONY_CAMERA_API**

For disease detection, I have used the **PLANT DISEASE** dataset. I have used the program provided by Kevalnagda for reference. Using his program I was not able to save the model. Due to this I made my model with his as a reference and saved it as an h5 file.

###  INSTRUCTIONS
1. Download the .h5 file, .pkl file and workinggui.py file.
2. Now open the workinggui.py file and update the addresses of the h5 and pkl file from the local directory.
3. Install QT5 creator and its subs.
4. For connecting and running the camera first do the steps in Blodevil's repo and install sony_camera_api.
5. After installing the same connect the camera using the sony remote option which will inturn connect the camera to the pc via WIFI.

### FEATURES THAT I AM PLANNING TO ADD TO THIS GUI

1. Add live streaming in the second window using opencv.
2. Send the captured image from the GUI to the pc/rasberriepie. As i am using a rasberrie pie I am not able to install sony play memories.
